# Diabetes_Prediction
ü©∫ How My Diabetes Prediction Project Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement
Predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on simple health metrics like:

Age

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Skin Thickness

2Ô∏è‚É£ Input Features
The user will input:

Age (years)

BMI (kg/m¬≤) ‚Äî body fat measure based on height and weight

Skin Thickness (mm) ‚Äî a health indicator related to fat percentage

3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model
I trained a classification model (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) using a diabetes dataset.

The model learns the relationship between Age, BMI, Skin Thickness, and the likelihood of having diabetes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Training Process
Data Collection:
Took a diabetes dataset (eg., PIMA Indians Diabetes Database).

Data Cleaning:

Removed or imputed missing values.

Normalized features if needed.

Feature Selection:
Only selected Age, BMI, Skin Thickness to keep it simple.

Model Training:
Trained using a supervised learning algorithm (Logistic Regression is simple and interpretable).

Evaluation:
Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve to check model performance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction Process (Working Flow)
User Inputs their Age, BMI, and Skin Thickness.

Model Processes these inputs through the trained algorithm.

Model Outputs either:

0 ‚Üí Not likely diabetic

1 ‚Üí Likely diabetic

Result is Displayed to the user immediately.
